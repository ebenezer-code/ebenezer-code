I'm passionate about crafting beautiful, accessible, and responsive web experiences, and also building my own company. I specialize in frontend development using JavaScript, React, and modern tools that bring ideas to life on the web.

💡 I love coding and constantly learning new technologies to stay ahead in the ever-evolving frontend world.

💬 Ask me about:
- Frontend Engineering (JavaScript, React, Next.js)
- UI/UX best practices
- Creating content that simplifies tech concepts

🏀⚽ Outside of tech, you’ll probably find me watching or playing basketball and football.

🍳 I also enjoy cooking up tasty meals and traveling to experience new cultures and cuisines.
